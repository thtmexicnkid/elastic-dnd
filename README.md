# Description
My attempt at using Elastic while playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons; mainly for note-taking, but also for anything else that comes to mind.

# Application Functions
* Login + Password system for access control
* Manual note input with a handful of types -- location, quest, person, overview
* Audio to text transcription from recorded session audio
* WORK IN PROGRESS -- Ask the Virtual DM questions about your sessions

# Dependencies
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  * Docker Desktop comes with Docker-Compose installed already; definitely the easier option.
* An [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/) API key for audio transcription

# Setup
### Docker setup
* Download or clone elastic-dnd repo to whatever directory/folder you want this to run from.


* Open command prompt / terminal and navigate to folder.
